    [Assembly Four](https://assemblyfour.com) is a collective of sex workers and technologists on a mission to empower sex workers through technology. Sex workers are among the most marginalised, stigmatised groups in the world, and our goal is to create platforms where sex workers thrive, not just survive.

    We were invited to speak at RubyConf AU in 2019 on the topic of [Internet Legislation is Eating the World](https://youtu.be/MDBm6_udqLg), covering how laws are being passed to erode digital rights and how we founded [Switter](https://switter.at/about), a sex worker-friendly social network, in an attempt to fight back.

    Our other project is [Tryst.link](https://tryst.link) (WARNING: adult content), the first LGBTQI+ friendly adult advertising platform, and is becoming the ethically-run platform of choice for independent sex workers in Australasia, North America and Europe.
